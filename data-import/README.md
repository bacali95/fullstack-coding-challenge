## Create a data import tool
A set of JSON files is provided, containing:
- List of accommodations [accommodations.json]
- List of reviews related to accommodations [reviews.json]
Write a program in any language you prefer to import the JSON data inside an instance of
PostgreSQL database, defining the data structure as you prefer.
We recommend using this docker image for quick setup of the database:
